[00:31.104]I see you
[00:33.081]You see me
[00:34.824]How pleasant
[00:36.456]This feeling
[00:38.264]The moment
[00:39.840]You hold me
[00:41.592]I missed you
[00:43.336]I'm sorry
[00:45.016]I've given
[00:46.952]What I have
[00:48.672]I showed you
[00:50.192]I'm growing
[00:51.984]The ashes
[00:53.640]Fall slowly
[00:55.296]As your voice
[00:56.880]Consoles me
[00:58.712]As the hours pass
[01:00.680]I will let you know
[01:02.320]That I need to ask
[01:03.896]Before I'm alone
[01:05.744]How it feels to rest
[01:07.280]On your patient lips
[01:08.984]To eternal bliss
[01:10.776]I'm so glad to know
[01:12.560]As the hours pass

[01:22.744]To eternal bliss
[01:24.448]I'm so glad to know
[01:26.496]We're swaying
[01:27.968]To drum beats
[01:29.624]In motion
[01:31.544]I'm feeling
[01:33.064]My patience
[00:00.000]Controlling
[01:36.584]The question
[01:38.240]I won't speak
[01:40.000]We're telling
[01:41.536]The stories
[01:43.264]Our laughter
[01:45.088]He knows me
[01:47.247]We're leaving
[01:48.479]We're talking
[01:50.168]You're closer
[01:51.984]It's calming
[01:53.464]As the hours pass
[01:55.368]I will let you know
[01:56.976]That I need to ask
[01:58.744]Before I'm alone

[02:17.610]To eternal bliss
[02:19.282]I'm so glad to know
[02:48.947]The night will hold us close
[02:50.603]And the stars will guide us home
[02:55.720]I've been waiting for this moment we're finally alone
[03:02.624]I turn to ask the question so anxious my thoughts
[03:09.528]Your lips were soft like winter in your passion I was lost
[03:15.605]As the hours pass
[03:17.542]I will let you know
[03:19.486]That I need to ask
[03:21.117]Before I'm alone
[03:22.853]How it feels to rest
