[00:16.263]Smoke in my vision so hazy
[00:19.714]Shots in the dark can’t make me fall
[00:22.991]Decisions in the past what made me
[00:25.079]All these eyes on me
[00:26.899]Can’t breathe
[00:27.616]Gotta keep from
[00:00.000]Falling

[00:35.516]Hurt me
[00:36.780]But the fire in my chest keeps
[00:00.000]Burning
[00:40.142]I’ma prove I deserve it
[00:42.975]Catch a breath
[00:44.624]Count to 10
[00:46.280]Take a sec
[00:47.099]Stomach feeling nauseous
[00:49.639]Say I’m fine
[00:51.331]Lie again
[00:52.974]These thoughts weighing on my conscience
[00:54.944]I think I’m
[00:55.883]Sick of myself
[00:56.861]Too hot headed don’t need no help
[00:58.376]I heard you talkin’
[00:59.538]That’s funny I got your bullet right over my belt
[01:01.839]Catch me
[01:02.455]Walkin’ through the flames
[01:03.454]No one in my way
[00:00.000]Nothing
[01:05.538]Nothing else has really changed
[01:06.764]Just the biggest stage
[01:07.985]I got…
[01:09.585]Smoke in my vision so hazy
[01:12.995]Shots in the dark can’t make me fall

[01:48.826]Voices in my head keep talking
[01:52.110]Nothing in my way could stop this
[01:55.459]I’ve been living life too cautious
[00:00.000]cautious
[01:58.822]Never want to be forgotten
[00:00.000]forgotten
