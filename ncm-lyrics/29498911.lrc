[00:10.564]Looking at it now
[00:14.674]It all seems so simple
[00:20.011]We were lying on your couch
[00:25.652]I remember
[00:30.555]You took a Polaroid of us
[00:35.864]Then discovered
[00:38.815]Then discovered
[00:40.746]The rest of the world was black and white
[00:45.912]But we were in screaming color
[00:50.892]And I remember thinking
[00:52.548]Are we out of the woods yet?
[00:53.913]Are we out of the woods yet?
[00:55.148]Are we out of the woods yet?
[00:56.544]Are we out of the woods?
[00:57.767]Are we in the clear yet?

[01:16.158]Are we out of the woods?
[01:18.577]Looking at it now
[01:22.801]Last December
[01:25.721]Last December
[01:28.351]We were built to fall apart
[01:32.881]Then fall back together
[01:36.162]Back together
[01:37.674]Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
[01:41.058]The night we couldn’t quite forget
[01:43.685]When we decided, we decided
[01:48.689]To move the furniture so we could dance
[01:52.063]Baby, like we stood a chance
[01:53.914]Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
[01:58.656]And I remember thinking
[02:00.403]Are we out of the woods yet?
[02:01.734]Are we out of the woods yet?
[02:02.955]Are we out of the woods yet?

[02:23.974]Are we out of the woods?
[02:26.597]Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
[02:29.402]Twenty stitches in a hospital room
[02:31.859]When you started crying, baby, I did too
[02:34.250]But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
[02:36.922]Remember when we couldn’t take the heat
[02:39.859]I walked out, I said I’m setting you free
[02:42.165]But the monsters turned out to be just trees
[02:44.808]When the sun came up, you were looking at me
[02:51.332]You were looking at me, oh
