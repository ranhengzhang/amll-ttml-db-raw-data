[00:04.753]It feels like a perfect night
[00:07.187]To dress up like hipsters
[00:09.420]And make fun of our exes, ah, ah, ah, ah
[00:13.849]It feels like a perfect night
[00:16.402]For breakfast at midnight
[00:18.675]To fall in love with strangers, ah, ah, ah, ah
[00:00.000]Yeah
[00:25.195]We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
[00:29.776]It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
[00:34.381]Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
[00:38.463]It's time, oh, oh
[00:42.475]I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
[00:46.492]Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
[00:51.721]You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
[00:55.680]Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
[01:01.159]22

[01:09.335]It seems like one of those nights
[01:11.890]This place is too crowded
[01:14.152]Too many cool kids, ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:16.051]"Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew!"
[01:18.473]It seems like one of those nights
[01:21.092]We ditch the whole scene
[01:23.386]And end up dreaming instead of sleeping, yeah
[01:29.830]We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
[01:34.341]It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
[01:39.051]Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
[01:43.128]It's time, oh, oh
[00:00.000]Hey!
[01:47.108]I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
